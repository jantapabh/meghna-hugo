The [health benefits](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/vegan-meat-life-expectancy-eggs-dairy-research-a7168036.html) of eating a predominantly plant-based diet are well documented – not to mention the [ethical and environmental](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/why-british-people-eat-less-meat-reasons-health-weight-environment-ethics-vegan-vegetarian-a7886076.html) pros of giving up meat for good.

There are a number of reasons why someone might want to opt for a diet _sans_ animals today, but what does veganism actually do to your body?

To mark World Vegan Day, we spoke to dieticians and nutrition experts who explained what happens to your body when you go vegan and why.

## **You feel tired**

Due to the absence of red meat in a plant-based diet, vegans (and vegetarians) are [typically deficient](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23356638) in vitamin B12 and iron.

This can lead to fatigue, headaches, dizziness and if left untreated, anaemia.

However, it’s very easy to supplement both B12 and iron, either by taking supplements or by eating vegan foods that are fortified with B12, such as yeast flakes.

There are also a number of foods which are naturally rich in iron, such as ground linseeds, nuts and spinach.

“Just remember to include at least one serving of iron-rich foods with every meal,” advises dietician [Bahee Van de Bor](http://www.nutritionist-resource.org.uk/nutritionists/bahee-van-de-bor), who specialises in paediatric nutrition.

## **Your calcium levels drop**

Omitting entire food groups from your diet will cause deficiencies across the board and when it comes to dairy, the deficiency-du-jour is calcium.

Like with iron and B12, however, this is easily remedied by proper supplementation.

“The solution lies in switching to a plant milk that is also calcium enriched,” suggests Van de Bor.

“Most soy-based drinks contain 120mg calcium per 100ml, a level that is similar to cow’s milk,” she told _The Independent_.
