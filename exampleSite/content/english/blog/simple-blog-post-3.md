## What is clean eating?

The idea is to only eat "clean" foods by cooking from scratch, choosing foods in their natural state, and eliminating refined sugar.

More extreme versions might exclude gluten, grains, dairy - or even encourage a raw food diet.

What's on the menu?

Pippa Selby, a clean eater for three years, starts the day with a bowl of smoothie, frozen fruit, fresh fruit, oats and a nut butter.

Lunch might be a homemade soup or a mozzarella salad. For dinner a sweet potato bake or grass-fed, free range meat and homemade chips.

Other clean-eating classics are the kale smoothie, smashed avocado, chia seeds and quinoa.

Where does it come from?

It's been around for about a decade, says dietician Catherine Collins.

A-list celebrities Gwyneth Paltrow, Katy Perry, Miranda Kerr and Jessica Alba are all reportedly fans. But it's foodie vloggers and bloggers who have given the concept wings.

Clean Eating Alice, also known as Alice Liveing, has half a million Instagram followers and two cookbooks to her name.

In [**a recent interview with the Sun,**](https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/2621733/clean-eating-star-alice-liveing-shares-tips-and-recipes/) she said she chose the term "clean eating" because it "perfectly encapsulated everything I wanted to do to my own diet - clean it up, get rid of a lot of the processed rubbish and begin eating real food again.

"I never once thought about restricting whole food groups from my diet, or placing metaphorical labels on foods and seeing them as either clean or unclean."

Food blogger Ella Mills - better known as Deliciously Ella - has distanced herself from the "clean-eating" label.

In BBC documentary "Clean Eating: The Dirty Truth" she said the word "clean" had become too "loaded".

"Clean now implies dirty and that's negative," she said.

"When I first read the term, it meant natural, kind of unprocessed, and now it doesn't mean that at all. It means diet. It means fad."
