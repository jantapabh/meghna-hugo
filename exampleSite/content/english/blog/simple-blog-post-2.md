## Before the emergence of COVID-19 and stay-at-home orders, one of the biggest complaints of busy individuals was not having time to prepare and cook balanced meals. A new appliance shows promise in solving that problem—for those who can afford it.

Before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and stay-at-home orders, one of the biggest complaints of busy individuals was not having time to prepare and cook balanced meals. A new appliance shows promise in solving that problem—for those who can afford it.

[**_Suvie_**](https://www.suvie.com/) is a smart countertop appliance that refrigerates and cooks an entire meal. The name comes from the method it uses to cook food: sous vide—a French cooking technique in which food is cooked while encased in a pouch and immersed in water. _Suvie_ has four compartment zones for each meal component—vegetables, protein, starch, and sauce. And each compartment zone is independently temperature-controlled, allowing each vacuum-sealed meal component to be refrigerated, stored, and cooked separately.

The appliance is fully programmable to allow each component of the meal to finish at the time a user wants to eat. In addition, the appliance has an optional broiler, which enables users to brown proteins and/or vegetables and gives them the look and flavor of roasting. Moreover, users can prepare meals with either the groceries they purchase or prepackaged _Smart Meals_ available via meal plans that users can purchase weekly or monthly. _Suvie_ sells for $1,199; prepackaged food/meals are sold separately. It is not clear whether recyclable vacuum-seal pouches needed to cook user-provided food are included with the purchase of the appliance or must be purchased separately.
